# Welcome to Actix

Actix Web lets you quickly and confidently develop web services in Rust and this guide will get you going in no time.

The documentation on this website focusses primarily on the Actix Web framework. For information about the actor framework called Actix, check out the [Actix chapter][actix-chapter] (or the lower level [actix API docs][actix-docs]). Otherwise, head on to the [getting started guide][getting-started]. If you already know your way around and you need specific information you might want to read the [actix-web API docs][actix-web-docs].
