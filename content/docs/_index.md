# Welcome to Actix

Actix is your door to developing web services with Rust and this documentation
is going to guide you.

This documentation currently covers mostly the `actix-web` part which is the high level
web framework previously built on top of the `actix` actor framework and the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs)
async IO system.  This is the part that is from an API stability point of view the most stable.

If you haven't used `actix-web` yet it's best to start with the [getting started
guide][gettingstarted].  If you already know your ways around and you need
specific information you might want to read the [actix-web API docs][actixwebdocs]
(or the lower level [actix API docs][actixdocs]).
