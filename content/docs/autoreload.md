# Auto-Reloading Development Server

During development it can be very handy to have cargo automatically recompile the code on changes. This can be accomplished very easily by using [`cargo-watch`].

```sh
cargo watch -x run
```

## Historical Note

An old version of this page recommended using a combination of systemfd and listenfd, but this has many gotchas and was difficult to integrate properly, especially when part of a broader development workflow. We consider [`cargo-watch`] to be sufficient for auto-reloading purposes.
